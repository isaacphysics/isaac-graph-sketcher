# Graph Sketcher

A graph sketching application for [Isaac Physics](https://isaacphysics.org).

## Usage

> npm install --save isaac-graph-sketcher

This is a little tricky to integrate right now but you can have a look at [our main repo](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-react-app) for a few examples.

This also depends on a [back-end checker](https://github.com/isaacphysics/isaac-graph-checker) written in Java.
